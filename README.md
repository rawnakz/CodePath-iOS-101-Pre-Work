In my free time, I love cycling around the boroughs in NYC. An issue I often face during my rides are poorly developed navigation routes. While navigation apps such as Google Maps or Apple Maps offer routes tailored to cyclists, they can be misleading or unfriendly at times. Thus, I'd love to develop a cycling navigation app providing bike-friendly routes based on AI-powered community feedback. It's simple as a user entering their destination and getting the best directions according to user reports. Similar to Waze, users can report incidents or route conditions to improve route generation, and users can get routes tailored to their preferences, whether its the kind of bike their using, if they are comfortable with steep hills, or if they want to avoid busy areas. I'd want to fully build it into a community-based platform, where users can share content about their rides while being able to efficiently navigate to their destinations. So think of it as the apps I mentioned above, but combined all together!
